**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

There has been a rise in ethics and privacy concerns when it comes to developing database algorithms and systems. Every action we take in our lives is ending up on a database somewhere, our hospital records, phone records, education, work history, our network of peoeple, even our dating history etc. Most of our existence can be summed up in a few databases. As such it has increasingly become a privacy concern for people. And it falls on the programmers to structure the alogrithms in a way to uphold the ethical and moral bounds of it. And to keep personal beliefs and biases out of the structure. 
For example, the article we read about the NADRA the national database of Pakistan, pointed out how the structure of the database is riddled with problems. Making anything that is out of the social norm hard to record and as a result of that so many people have to go through hardships because their lifes cannot be defined by a boolean true or false. And the problem solely arises due to the personal biases of the people who designed it that way where a person's existence can be denied by a boolean false. 
In regards to the farmers market database we have been working with the only thing I would say is maybe we should not have access to the customers names and postal codes, given that anyone with the wrong intentions can just locate a person based on those two things alone, which makes it a safety concern. Incidents like that are not unheard of.  Instead maybe we should only be using numbers or aliases to protect peoples privacy. But also as people working with the database need to uphold their end of the moral code as well. 
We need to ensure that when we are developing these databases our personal or societal biases do not affect a person. So that anything we do to fulfill business objectives does not promote social injustice in anyway.
